s at your disposal to help you expand your technical expertise into new are=
as, including classroom training, online training, and Redbooks. Making the=
 jump from formal education to being able to independently implement IBM pr=
oducts in the field, however, is often greatly facilitated by technical men=
toring by an experienced, senior consultant. <br>
 <br>
IBM Systems Lab Services is pleased to announce that partners who have achi=
eved Partner Growth Incentive (PGI,) Specialty, or Specialty Elite status f=
or Storage can now redeem class vouchers for technical mentoring services o=
n Storage technologies, and partners who have achieved PGI, Specialty, or S=
pecialty Elite status for Power can now redeem class vouchers for technical=
 mentoring services on Power technologies. Our skilled consultants have the=
 broad architectural knowledge, deep technical skills, and best practices e=
xpertise=E2=80=94 based on real-world experience=E2=80=94 to advise your co=
nsultants on solution design, rapid deployment, integration, configuration =
and optimization of IBM Storage and Power products. <br>
 <br>
Our implementation experts will work with your consultants, at your custome=
r site or remotely, providing deep technical guidance that will enable your=
 teams to support the successful implementation of IBM solutions. This has =
several significant benefits for your business: <br>
<ul><li>IBM will help you anticipate and avoid common pitfalls in product i=
mplementation, helping to ensure that your first customer engagement is a s=
uccess <br></li>
<li>IBM will advise your team on field-proven best practices in implementin=
g IBM Storage product solutions, giving your customer greater value from yo=
ur services <br></li>
<li>Accelerated technical enablement will allow you to see a return on your=
 training investment much more quickly, and will open the doors to new busi=
ness opportunities <br></li>
<li>Use of class vouchers will significantly lower the cost of technical en=
ablement for your team <br></li></ul>
 <br>
Technical mentoring engagements can be as short as three days, or can be ex=
panded to meet your needs. You will decide how the mentoring services are b=
est used, from project planning, solution design and review, to installatio=
n and configuration. We are happy to accompany you on site at your customer=
 location, or help you remotely, behind the scenes. It's your choice. Pleas=
e keep in mind that, because our consultants are constantly in the field at=
 customer sites, mentor availability will vary. There are some additional r=
estrictions on this program to ensure that you derive maximum benefit from =
our mentoring services- please contact Volker Kapp at volker.kapp@de.ibm.co=
m for additional information. <br><br><br></td><td><img src=3D"http://www.i=
